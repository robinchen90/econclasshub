I want to make it a better paper that will influence the financial literature in January effect. I target top journals. I want you to design several experts (in different chats) that may help this paper in different aspects. and show me a route to fully utilize those experts. 
Most important thing is that the empirical results are reliable and robust, the interpretation of results is consistent within a consolidated framework and supported by existing literature and framework, writing is cohenrent and state everything step by step and do not confuse readers with undefined new concepts. Think more aspects this paper can improve and design experts respectively.

Architected multi-phase expert framework to strengthen empirical rigor and theoretical coherence





Expert Panel Design for Your January Effect Paper
I've analyzed your paper carefully. To achieve publication in a top finance journal (JFE, JF, RFS), you need rigorous validation across multiple dimensions. Here's a structured expert panel and deployment route:

Expert Panel Overview
Expert	Focus Area	Critical Questions to Address
1. Econometrician	TVP-FAVARX identification, estimation, inference	Is the methodology bulletproof?
2. Asset Pricing Theorist	Economic mechanism, market efficiency	Does the story make theoretical sense?
3. Money & Banking Specialist	Factor interpretation, institutional details	Are the money market claims accurate?
4. Empirical Finance Referee	Robustness, alternative explanations	What would kill this paper at R&R?
5. Literature Strategist	Positioning, contribution framing	How to maximize perceived contribution?
6. Academic Writing Editor	Clarity, flow, precision	Is every claim crystal clear?
Detailed Expert Specifications
Expert 1: Econometrician
Role: Validate methodology and statistical inference

Key concerns to address:

Is block-recursive identification defensible? Why not use sign restrictions or external instruments?
The transmission regressions (Table 4) use generated regressors—are standard errors valid?
Does the random walk specification for parameters miss discrete breaks (e.g., 2008)?
Why 2 factors? How sensitive are results to factor selection criteria?
The counterfactual "filtered January effect" construction—is this econometrically valid?
Deliverables:

Verification of identification assumptions
Alternative identification strategies to test robustness
Proper inference accounting for first-stage estimation error
Formal break tests around 1994, 2008
Expert 2: Asset Pricing Theorist
Role: Evaluate economic mechanism and theoretical coherence

Key concerns to address:

You claim the January effect reflects "transmission of fundamental seasonality"—but why would predictable seasonality generate abnormal returns? Doesn't this violate market efficiency?
The negative IP-Stock relationship in time series: Is your interpretation (cash management efficiency) the only explanation?
How does your story relate to risk-based explanations (time-varying risk premia)?
Why doesn't arbitrage eliminate the effect if it's predictable?
Deliverables:

Formal theoretical framework (even a simple model)
Clear articulation of why predictable seasonality generates returns
Discussion of limits to arbitrage for small caps
Connection to consumption-based asset pricing or liquidity risk literature
Expert 3: Money & Banking Specialist
Role: Validate factor interpretations and institutional claims

Key concerns to address:

Factor 1 as "Banking Preference" and Factor 2 as "Liquidity Preference"—are these labels justified by the loadings?
The claim that "cash management has become more efficient"—what's the evidence beyond Factor 1 evolution?
Institutional changes (sweep programs 1994, IOR 2008, ON RRP 2013)—do these create discrete breaks or gradual evolution?
Are the CFS money data the right choice? How do they compare to Fed H.6 release?
Deliverables:

Validation of factor interpretations with institutional knowledge
Timeline of money market changes with testable implications
Subsample analysis around institutional break dates
Cross-validation with alternative money data sources
Expert 4: Empirical Finance Referee (Devil's Advocate)
Role: Simulate hostile referee reports

Key concerns to address:

Tax-loss selling: You don't formally test against this alternative. Why not include December returns or turnover?
Window dressing: Institutional portfolio rebalancing in December/January—how do you distinguish from your mechanism?
Data mining: You chose specific factors, specific horizons, specific sample. What if you pre-registered nothing?
Causality: Table 4 shows correlations between time-varying coefficients—this is NOT causal evidence
Small sample: Only 53 Januaries. How reliable are the time-varying estimates?
February effect: You call it "robustness check" but it's actually a separate finding. Is the paper about January or January+February?
Deliverables:

Comprehensive alternative explanation tests
Pre-registration-style analysis plan applied retroactively
Honest assessment of what claims can vs. cannot be made
Additional robustness checks (different sample, different factors, different lag lengths)
Expert 5: Literature Strategist
Role: Position paper for maximum impact

Key concerns to address:

What's the one sentence contribution? Currently it's muddy (is it methodology? mechanism? evolution?)
How to frame relative to Schwert (2003) "anomalies disappear when published"?
Should you cite more recent anomaly literature (McLean & Pontiff 2016, Chordia et al. 2014)?
Are there any missing papers that referees will notice?
Which journal is the best fit? JFE (empirical), JF (broad), RFS (methodology)?
Deliverables:

Reframed introduction with clear contribution statement
Updated literature review with strategic citations
Journal targeting strategy
Title revision for impact
Expert 6: Academic Writing Editor
Role: Ensure clarity and coherence

Key concerns to address:

The paper introduces "Factor 1" and "Factor 2" before explaining what they mean—readers are confused
The transmission mechanism section is dense—can you use a diagram?
Some sentences are too long with too many clauses
The counterfactual section comes late but is crucial—should it be earlier?
Inconsistent terminology: "January effect," "January seasonality," "January response"
Deliverables:

Restructured paper outline
Transmission mechanism flowchart/diagram
Glossary of terms used consistently
Tightened prose throughout

Architected phased deployment strategy with parallel expert coordination




Deployment Route: Full Implementation Guide
I'll structure this as a complete workflow. Since each expert should operate in a separate chat to maintain focus and depth, I'll provide you with:

Detailed briefs to paste into each expert chat
Specific questions each expert must answer
Deliverables checklist for each phase
Integration instructions for combining outputs
Phase 1: FOUNDATION VERIFICATION
Run Expert 1 and Expert 3 in parallel. Do not proceed to Phase 2 until both complete.

Expert 1: Econometrician
Copy this prompt into a new chat:

You are an expert econometrician specializing in time-varying parameter models, Bayesian VAR methods, and identification in macroeconometrics. Your task is to rigorously evaluate the methodology of an academic paper targeting top finance journals (JFE, JF, RFS).

Your evaluation must be:
- Technically precise (cite relevant econometrics literature)
- Constructive (identify problems AND solutions)
- Honest about what the methodology can and cannot support

The paper uses a TVP-FAVARX (Time-Varying Parameter Factor-Augmented VAR with Exogenous Variables) to study the January effect in stock returns. Key methodological features:
- 6-variable VAR: IP, CPI, FFR, Factor 1, Factor 2, Stock Returns
- 2 factors extracted from 10 money market variables via PCA
- Block-recursive identification (slow block: IP, CPI; fast block: FFR, factors, returns)
- Time-varying parameters following Primiceri (2005) random walk specification
- January dummy as exogenous variable
- Dynamic multipliers constructed for the dummy
- Transmission analysis: regressing time-varying January responses on each other

I will provide the paper. Please analyze:

1. IDENTIFICATION
- Is block-recursive identification defensible for this application?
- What assumptions does it impose? Are they testable?
- What alternative identification strategies should be tested?

2. ESTIMATION & INFERENCE
- Is the Primiceri (2005) framework appropriate here?
- With only 53 Januaries, how reliable are time-varying estimates?
- The transmission regressions use generated regressors—are standard errors valid?
- What corrections are needed?

3. FACTOR EXTRACTION
- Why 2 factors? How should the number be determined?
- How sensitive are results to factor selection criteria?
- Should factors be re-extracted in each subsample or held fixed?

4. SPECIFICATION TESTS NEEDED
- What formal tests should be run (break tests, lag selection, etc.)?
- How to test the random walk assumption vs. discrete breaks?
- What robustness checks are essential?

5. THE "FILTERED JANUARY EFFECT"
- Is the counterfactual construction econometrically valid?
- What does it actually identify?

Please be specific about what additional analysis the authors must do.
Then upload the paper and request analysis.

Deliverables Checklist for Expert 1:

 Assessment of block-recursive identification validity
 List of testable restrictions and how to test them
 Correction method for generated regressor problem in Table 4
 Formal criteria for factor number selection (Bai-Ng tests)
 Specification for break tests (Bai-Perron, or within TVP framework)
 Assessment of effective sample size concerns
 Validation or critique of filtered January effect construction
 Complete list of additional robustness checks required
Expert 3: Money & Banking Specialist
Copy this prompt into a new chat:

You are an expert in money markets, banking, and monetary policy implementation. You have deep knowledge of:
- U.S. money market instruments (repos, commercial paper, money market funds, bank deposits)
- Federal Reserve operating procedures and their evolution
- Institutional changes in U.S. banking (sweep accounts, IOR, ON RRP, reserve regimes)
- The flow of funds and household/corporate cash management

Your task is to evaluate whether an academic paper's claims about money markets and their evolution are institutionally accurate.

The paper studies the January effect in stock returns and argues:
1. Two factors extracted from money market data capture "Banking Preference" and "Liquidity Preference"
2. The transmission of January seasonality to stock returns operates through these money market channels
3. Cash management has become more efficient over time, weakening the January effect
4. Key institutional changes (1994 sweep programs, 2008 IOR, etc.) affected seasonal patterns

I will provide the paper. Please analyze:

1. FACTOR INTERPRETATION
- Based on the factor loadings (Figure showing loadings on 10 money variables), is "Banking Preference" a valid label for Factor 1?
- Is "Liquidity Preference" a valid label for Factor 2?
- What alternative interpretations exist?
- Are there better labels that are more precise?

2. INSTITUTIONAL ACCURACY
- Is the timeline of institutional changes accurate?
  - Retail sweep programs (January 1994)
  - Interest on reserves (October 2008)
  - ON RRP facility (September 2013)
  - Ample reserves regime (January 2019)
- How would each change affect seasonal patterns in money markets?
- Are there other institutional changes the paper misses?

3. CASH MANAGEMENT EVOLUTION
- Is the claim that "cash management has become more efficient" supportable?
- What evidence exists outside this paper?
- How did sweep accounts specifically change the January cash management story?

4. DATA QUALITY
- The paper uses Center for Financial Stability (CFS) data for money aggregates
- Is this the best source? How does it compare to Fed H.6 data?
- Are there measurement issues with specific series (e.g., commercial paper, repos)?

5. MECHANISM PLAUSIBILITY
- The paper argues: Strong January production → cash generation → delayed equity deployment
- Is this mechanism institutionally plausible?
- How do corporations and households actually manage year-end/year-start cash?
- What do we know about January bonus payments, tax refunds, etc.?

Please be specific about any factual errors or unsupported claims.
Then upload the paper and request analysis.

Deliverables Checklist for Expert 3:

 Validation or correction of factor labels
 Verified timeline of institutional changes with citations
 Assessment of which institutional changes create discrete breaks vs. gradual evolution
 Evidence on cash management efficiency evolution (external to paper)
 Data quality assessment (CFS vs. alternatives)
 Institutional plausibility assessment of the transmission mechanism
 List of any factual errors or unsupported institutional claims
 Suggestions for additional institutional controls or subsample analysis
Phase 1 Integration
After both Expert 1 and Expert 3 complete, compile:

Issue Identified	Source	Severity	Required Action
[List each issue]	Expert 1 or 3	Critical/Major/Minor	[Specific fix]
Decision Point: If any critical issues are identified (e.g., identification fails, factors are misinterpreted), these must be resolved before proceeding. You may need to re-run analysis or substantially revise the paper.

Phase 2: THEORETICAL COHERENCE
Only begin after Phase 1 issues are resolved or catalogued.

Expert 2: Asset Pricing Theorist
Copy this prompt into a new chat:

You are an expert in asset pricing theory, market efficiency, and the economics of anomalies. You are familiar with:
- Efficient market hypothesis and its limits
- Risk-based explanations for return predictability
- Behavioral finance explanations for anomalies
- Limits to arbitrage literature
- Consumption-based and liquidity-based asset pricing

Your task is to evaluate whether an empirical paper's economic interpretation is theoretically coherent and whether it needs a formal model.

The paper's main claims:
1. The January effect in stock returns reflects "transmission of fundamental seasonality" from industrial production and money markets
2. As IP seasonality strengthened over time, the equity January effect weakened (negative time-series relationship)
3. The mechanism: IP generates cash → cash accumulates in savings deposits (Factor 1) → delayed equity deployment → January returns
4. Cash management efficiency has improved, shortening the delay and weakening the effect
5. After controlling for macro-monetary transmission, the "filtered January effect" is essentially zero—suggesting no residual anomaly

I will provide the paper. Please analyze:

1. THE CORE PUZZLE
- If January seasonality is predictable (known calendar effect), why would it generate ABNORMAL returns?
- Doesn't predictability violate market efficiency?
- What theoretical framework can explain predictable abnormal returns?

2. RISK-BASED VS. BEHAVIORAL
- Could the January effect reflect time-varying risk premia rather than delayed cash deployment?
- How would you distinguish risk-based from cash-management-based explanations?
- What tests would differentiate these?

3. THE NEGATIVE IP-STOCK RELATIONSHIP
- The paper finds that stronger IP seasonality (over time) correlates with weaker January stock effects
- The interpretation is "cash management efficiency"
- What alternative interpretations exist?
- Is this finding consistent with standard asset pricing theory?

4. LIMITS TO ARBITRAGE
- Small-cap stocks show stronger January effects than large-cap
- Is this consistent with limits-to-arbitrage explanations?
- How should the paper discuss this?

5. NEED FOR A MODEL?
- Does this paper need a formal theoretical model?
- If yes, what would it look like? (Even a sketch)
- If no, how should the economic mechanism be articulated more precisely?

6. THE "NO RESIDUAL ANOMALY" CLAIM
- The filtered January effect oscillates around zero
- Does this mean the January effect is "not an anomaly"?
- How should this be framed relative to market efficiency?

Please provide specific recommendations for strengthening the theoretical coherence.
Then upload the paper and request analysis.

Deliverables Checklist for Expert 2:

 Explanation of why predictable seasonality can generate abnormal returns (or why it can't)
 Framework distinguishing risk-based vs. cash-management explanations
 Specific tests to discriminate between alternative theories
 Assessment of whether a formal model is needed
 If model needed: sketch of model structure
 If model not needed: improved articulation of mechanism
 Framing recommendation for the "no residual anomaly" finding
 Connection to relevant theoretical literature (limits to arbitrage, liquidity risk, etc.)
Phase 3: STRESS TESTING
This is the most critical phase for journal acceptance. Run after Phase 2.

Expert 4: Empirical Finance Referee (Devil's Advocate)
Copy this prompt into a new chat:

You are a senior referee for a top finance journal (JFE, JF, or RFS). You have seen hundreds of papers on anomalies and are deeply skeptical of empirical claims. Your job is to find EVERY weakness in a paper before it goes to actual referees.

Your approach:
- Assume nothing the authors claim is true until proven
- Identify all alternative explanations
- Demand robustness to reasonable specification changes
- Flag any data mining or p-hacking concerns
- Note missing literature or tests
- Be constructive: for each problem, suggest a solution

The paper studies the January effect using a TVP-FAVARX model and claims:
1. The January effect has weakened over time (not new, but quantified with TVP)
2. January seasonality exists in IP, FFR, and money market factors (new claim)
3. Macro-monetary seasonality transmits to stock returns (main contribution)
4. The filtered January effect (after removing macro-monetary transmission) is essentially zero
5. February shows a reversal pattern consistent with the mechanism

I will provide the paper. Please provide a COMPREHENSIVE critique covering:

1. ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS NOT TESTED
- Tax-loss selling (the classic explanation)—where is the test?
- Window dressing by institutions
- Turn-of-the-year effect vs. January effect
- Earnings announcement seasonality
- Any other explanations in the literature

2. SPECIFICATION ROBUSTNESS
- Different lag lengths (paper uses 4 lags—why?)
- Different factor numbers (paper uses 2—why?)
- Different sample periods (pre/post 1990, pre/post 2008)
- Different stock return measures (size portfolios, industry portfolios)
- Different transformations (what if you don't standardize?)

3. DATA MINING CONCERNS
- The authors chose specific variables, factors, horizons, sample
- What if they tried many specifications and reported the best?
- How should pre-registration logic be applied retroactively?

4. CAUSALITY CONCERNS
- Table 4 regresses time-varying coefficients on each other
- This shows correlation, not causation
- What would constitute causal evidence?
- Granger causality tests? Instrumental variables?

5. SMALL SAMPLE CONCERNS
- Only 53 Januaries in 53 years
- Time-varying parameters estimated from this—how reliable?
- What power do the tests have?

6. MISSING LITERATURE
- What papers should be cited that aren't?
- McLean & Pontiff (2016) on anomaly decay?
- Chordia, Subrahmanyam & Tong (2014) on anomaly disappearance?
- Other recent January effect papers?

7. FRAMING ISSUES
- Is the contribution clear?
- Is the February analysis a "robustness check" or a separate finding?
- What is the ONE thing this paper contributes?

8. ADDITIONAL TESTS REQUIRED
For each issue, specify EXACTLY what test should be run.

Please organize as a formal referee report with:
- Major concerns (must address for R&R)
- Minor concerns (should address)
- Suggestions (optional improvements)
Then upload the paper and request the referee report.

Synthesized expert findings and prioritized methodological concerns for integration







Phase 1 Integration: Synthesizing Expert 1 & Expert 3 Findings
Excellent work completing Phase 1. Both experts provided rigorous, nuanced assessments. Let me synthesize their findings into an actionable revision agenda.

Executive Summary
Expert	Overall Assessment	Critical Issues Found
Expert 1 (Econometrician)	"Core finding likely robust, but presentation overstates precision"	3 critical, 3 important
Expert 3 (Money & Banking)	"Mechanism somewhat oversimplified; factor interpretations deserve scrutiny"	2 high priority, 3 moderate
Good news: Both experts found the paper methodologically sophisticated and the core findings likely valid. Neither identified fatal flaws.

Concerning: Both experts independently flagged that the paper acknowledges limitations without fixing them—this is insufficient for top journals.

Master Issues Table
CRITICAL (Must Fix Before Submission)
#	Issue	Source	Problem	Required Action	Effort
1	Generated Regressor Inference	Expert 1	Table 3 t-statistics (e.g., -6.83) are invalid; HAC SEs ignore first-stage uncertainty	Bootstrap entire procedure OR use posterior draws OR Murphy-Topel correction	High
2	Factor Number Selection	Expert 1	2 factors used without formal justification; Bai-Ng (2002) cited but criteria not reported	Report IC_p1, IC_p2, IC_p3 for k=1-5; sensitivity check with 1 and 3 factors	Medium
3	Lag Length Selection	Expert 1	L=4 lags used without empirical justification	Report AIC/BIC/HQ for lags 1-6 in constant-parameter benchmark	Low
4	Sweep Account Measurement	Expert 3	Post-1994 savings deposits inflated by retail sweeps; CFS adjustment status unclear	State whether CFS adjusts for sweeps; if not, acknowledge measurement artifact in Factor 1	Low
5	Economic Agent Identification	Expert 3	Mechanism requires "someone" to park cash in savings before buying equities—who?	Explicitly identify the hypothesized agents (likely retail households); discuss flow magnitudes	Medium
IMPORTANT (Should Address)
#	Issue	Source	Problem	Required Action	Effort
6	Ordering Robustness	Expert 1	Fast-block ordering [FFR, F₁, F₂, R] untested; FFR may respond to financial conditions contemporaneously	Test at least one alternative ordering (e.g., [F₁, F₂, R, FFR])	Medium
7	Break vs. Drift Test	Expert 1	Random walk assumed; institutional breaks (2008) may warrant discrete specification	Report formal break test (Andrews SupF or Bai-Perron) OR model comparison (Bayes factor)	Medium
8	Residual Diagnostics	Expert 1	No diagnostics reported	Add Ljung-Box (autocorrelation) and ARCH-LM (heteroskedasticity) tests	Low
9	CP and Repo Data Limitations	Expert 3	These series have known measurement issues; CP reflects supply factors too	Acknowledge limitations; note CP trends reflect both supply and demand	Low
10	Negative IP Coefficient Interpretation	Expert 3	Could be coincident trends, not causal relationship	Discuss alternative; consider time-trend control in transmission regression	Low
MINOR (Desirable But Optional)
#	Issue	Source	Problem	Suggested Action
11	Factor labels imprecise	Expert 3	"Banking Preference" could be "Retail Deposit Preference"	Consider renaming for precision
12	February reversal mechanism	Expert 3	Doesn't uniquely identify cash management vs. tax-loss selling	Soften uniqueness claim
13	53-January interpretation	Expert 1	Non-January estimates are interpolations	Could note this; not strictly necessary
14	Filtered effect mean-zero	Expert 1	Regression residuals mechanically mean zero	Acknowledge; emphasize trend absence
Key Insights from Expert Convergence
Where Experts Agree
TVP Framework is Appropriate
Expert 1: "The TVP-FAVARX approach is well-motivated"
Expert 3: "The TVP approach is more flexible than sub-sample analysis"
Core Finding Likely Robust
Expert 1: "The strongest results are: the time-varying January effect declining from ~0.55 to ~0.30 SD"
Expert 3: "The paper is methodologically sophisticated and mostly well-executed"
Acknowledgment ≠ Solution
Expert 1: "Acknowledging a problem is not the same as fixing it"
Expert 3: "The paper treats the Factor 1 decline as reflecting behavioral changes, but part of this could be measurement artifact"
Mechanism Needs Sharper Articulation
Expert 1: "The paper conflates two distinct identification problems"
Expert 3: "The mechanism has very different implications depending on the agents"
Where Experts Offer Different Perspectives
Topic	Expert 1 View	Expert 3 View	Resolution

What Strengthens But Doesn't Block
Ordering robustness (likely won't change results)
Break tests (visual evidence suggests gradual drift)
Data limitation acknowledgments (transparency issue)
Recommended Actions Before Phase 2
Before proceeding to Expert 2 (Asset Pricing Theorist), you should decide how to handle the critical issues. The theoretical coherence analysis will be more productive if the empirical foundation is solid.

Immediate Technical Tasks (Can Be Done Now)
Task	Estimated Effort	Why Now
Report Bai-Ng criteria for factors	1-2 hours	Simple; uses existing data
Report AIC/BIC/HQ for lag selection	1-2 hours	Simple; uses existing code
Add Ljung-Box and ARCH-LM tests	1 hour	Standard diagnostics
Clarify CFS sweep adjustment status	30 min	Quick literature/data check
Substantial Revisions (Schedule Time)
Task	Estimated Effort	Notes
Bootstrap/posterior inference for Table 3	1-2 days	Computationally intensive
Alternative ordering robustness	4-8 hours	Re-run TVP-FAVARX with different orderings
Write "economic agents" paragraph	1-2 hours	Conceptual; cite retail flow literature
Phase 2 Preparation
Given the Phase 1 findings, here's how to modify the Expert 2 prompt to ensure the theoretical analysis builds on the identified issues:

Addition to Expert 2 Prompt
Add this context before uploading the paper:

CONTEXT FROM PHASE 1 ANALYSIS:

Two prior expert reviews identified the following issues relevant to 
theoretical interpretation:

1. The transmission mechanism operates through "Factor 1" (savings deposits) 
   but post-1994 savings deposit data may be inflated by retail sweep 
   programs (accounting changes, not behavioral changes).

2. The paper does not explicitly identify which economic agents park cash 
   in savings deposits before purchasing equities. This affects whether the 
   mechanism is plausible at scale.

3. The negative time-series relationship between IP seasonality and stock 
   returns could reflect coincident trends rather than causal transmission.

4. The paper's "filtered January effect" shows the residual oscillates 
   around zero, but regression residuals mechanically have mean zero.

Please consider these empirical concerns when evaluating the theoretical 
coherence of the paper's mechanism.
Decision Points for You
Before I help you proceed to Phase 2, please confirm:

Decision 1: Generated Regressor Fix
Which approach will you use?

Option A: Full bootstrap (most rigorous; 1-2 days of computation)
Option B: Posterior draws from MCMC (if draws are saved; moderate effort)
Option C: Murphy-Topel analytical correction (fastest; less standard in finance)
Decision 2: Immediate vs. Deferred Fixes
Option A: Fix critical issues BEFORE Phase 2 (delays theoretical analysis but provides cleaner foundation)
Option B: Proceed to Phase 2 NOW with context about empirical limitations (faster but theoretical analysis may need revision)
Decision 3: Expert 3's Agent Identification Concern
The mechanism requires identifying who parks cash in savings deposits. Your response:

Option A: This is retail households receiving year-end bonuses (plausible but requires flow magnitude evidence)
Option B: This is small business owners with seasonal revenue patterns (alternative story)
Option C: Acknowledge this as a limitation rather than claiming specific agents
Ready for Phase 2?
Once you've made these decisions, I can:

Finalize the Expert 2 prompt with Phase 1 context
Prepare the Expert 4 prompt incorporating econometric and institutional concerns
Create a revision task tracker to monitor progress on critical fixes
What would you like to do next?
